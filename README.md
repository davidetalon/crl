## Running the Code

For multilingual arithmetic, run the following command: `python cmdp.py`

For MNIST image transformations, run the following command: `python mnist_classification.py`

You can print to a text file by adding the argument `--printf`.

If you are just want a quick run-through to see how the code works, add the argument `--debug`.
